## 🧠 Week 1 (Part 5): Algorithm Basics

### 📌 What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a **step-by-step procedure** or a set of rules to solve a problem or perform a task.

Think of it like a cooking recipe:

* Input: Ingredients
* Process: Recipe steps
* Output: Delicious food 🍝

### 🧮 Key Characteristics of a Good Algorithm

| Characteristic    | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**         | Takes one or more inputs                            |
| **Output**        | Produces at least one output                        |
| **Definiteness**  | Every step is clear and unambiguous                 |
| **Finiteness**    | The process ends after a finite number of steps     |
| **Effectiveness** | Each step is basic enough to be performed with ease |

### ✏️ Example 1: Sum of Two Numbers

**Problem**: Add two numbers.

**Algorithm**:

1. Start
2. Take two numbers as input → `a` and `b`
3. Add them → `sum = a + b`
4. Display the result
5. End

**Python Code**:

```python
a = 5
b = 7
sum = a + b
print("Sum is:", sum)
```

### 🔍 Example 2: Find the Largest of 3 Numbers

**Steps**:

1. Take 3 numbers as input
2. Compare them using `if` conditions
3. Print the largest

**Python Code**:

```python
a = 10
b = 25
c = 15

if a >= b and a >= c:
    print("Largest:", a)
elif b >= a and b >= c:
    print("Largest:", b)
else:
    print("Largest:", c)
```

### 💡 Why Algorithms Matter

* They're the **core of problem-solving** in computer science.
* Help optimize **time and space** usage in your programs.
* Used everywhere: Google search, YouTube recommendations, Maps navigation, etc.
